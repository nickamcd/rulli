      <h1>About Emporio Rulli</h1>
      <p>
        The Emporio Rulli concept is about creating a 
        genuine, authentic Italian coffee and pastry 
        bar experience for our guests in the San 
        Francisco Bay Area.
      </p>
      <p>
        As a 4th generation native San Franciscan 
        whose grandparents and great grandparents 
        emigrated to the San Francisco Bay Area in the 
        early 20th century, we have, for the past 33 
        years, been ambassadors of Italian culture and 
        gastronomy.  Everything you see in our beautiful, 
        Italian-designed show cases is made 365 days 
        a year in our pastry and savory kitchen in 
        Larkspur.  Our selection of artisan handmade 
        pastries, breads, paninis, macarons, salads 
        and handcrafted coffees are all unique and 
        authentic and are only found in our family 
        run operation.

        Being the only Italian American inducted into AMPI, 
        Accademia Maestri Pasticceria Italiana (Italian 
        Pastry Masters Academy) in Brescia, Italy, keeps us 
        in the forefront of all the latest pastry, coffee 
        and food trends as well as centuriesâ€™ old traditions 
        to surprise and delight our customers on a daily 
        basis.  Our coffee is roasted bi-weekly in our 
        roasting plant by Chef Rulli himself, having been 
        trained by Alfred Peet (well-known as the creator 
        of the artisan coffee movement as well as the 
        founder of Peets Coffee & Tea). 
      </p>
      <p>
        We are unique in the Bay Area for both roasting coffee 
        and producing all of our products in house, setting us 
        apart from all of our competitors.
